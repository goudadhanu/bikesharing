# Bike Sharing Assignment
> A bike-sharing system in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. It allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

## The company wants to know:
> Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
> How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Business objective
> The objective is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.


## Problem Solving Methodology

### Data Understanding-
> Understanding and working with data dictionary and getting good knowledge of all the columns and their domain specific uses.

### Data Visualization-
> Perform EDA to understand various variables. Check the correlation between the variables.

### Data Preparation-
> Create dummy variables for all the categorical features. Divide the data to train & Test. Perform Scaling. Divide data into dependent & Independent variables.

###Data Modelling & Evaluation-
> Create Linear Regression model using mixed approach (RFE & VIF/p-value). Check the various assumptions. Check the Adjusted R-Square for both train & Test data. Report the final model.


## Technologies Used
> Python - version 3.9.12

## Libraries Used
> Pandas , Numpy , Matplotlib , Seaborn , sklearn , statsmodels

## Conclusion
Significant variables to predict the demand for shared bikes
